# Tetris game utilizing, HTML, CSS, and Javascript

I'm going to be making a webpage that has a tetris game for a good friend of mine who loves the game. I will be utilizing things like a canvas, flex box,
arrow functions, template literals, classes variables, and scope. Below will be a short explantation on how the game will work, and how to play.

Controls: arrow key(left) = move left 
          arrow key(down) = move down
          arrow key(right) = move right
          arrow key(up) = flip shape
          Escape(ESC) = pause
